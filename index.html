        <p>Are you interested in becoming a developer, but find all of the options available a bit overwhelming?</p>
        <p><strong>Don't worry</strong> - you're not alone.</p>
        <p>Epicodus is ultimately about <em>teaching you how to learn</em>. While you'll work with several specific languages during your program, you'll also be learning core concepts of programming that translate to essentially every other language out there. Picking up new languages down the road won't be as hard as it sounds!</p>
        <p>Still, there's something to be said for developing a strong foundation in languages that truly interest you. This quick quiz can help point you in the right direction.</p>

        <h2>Ruby + Ruby on Rails</h2>
        <p>Ruby is a favorite of web-focused developers, especially those who are interested in building applications that users can interact with. AirBNB, Groupon, and Hulu are just a few examples of popular websites built with Ruby.</p>
        <p>Ruby is <em>very</em> often used in cojunction with a framework called "Ruby on Rails", or "Rails" for short. Rails is basically a collection of pre-built functions (think of them as miniature programs), which simplify a lot of the most common tasks a Ruby developer might need to do.</p>

      <div id="javaAndroid">
        <h2>Java + Android</h2>
        <p>Java might just be the most popular programming language in use today. It's used for everything from web and mobile apps to high-performance enterprise software. Java has long history of use in <em>many</em> major applications - the underlying language is actually more than two decades old!</p>
        <p>Java is also the official language of Android app development. Since Android is currently the most popular operating system out there, it's no surprise that capable Java and Android developers are still in very high demand by businesses large and small.</p>

      <div id="cSharpDotNet">
        <h2>C# + .NET</h2>
        <p>C# (pronounced as "see sharp") is a flexible language used to develop everything from desktop software to mobile apps to video games. And because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it's one of the most in-demand languages - especially by large, established corporations and government agencies.</p>
        <p>Epicodus students also learn to use the .NET framework, which is basically a collection of pre-built functions (think of them as miniature programs) that simplify a lot of the most common tasks a C# developer might need to do. .NET is particularly useful for building web applications with C# - some popular websites built on .NET include Microsoft's own site, Bing, and Stack Overflow.</p>
