        <h1>Which Coding Track Is Right For Me?</h1>
        <p>Are you interested in becoming a developer, but find all of the options available a bit overwhelming?</p>
        <p><strong>Don't worry</strong> - you're not alone.</p>
        <p>Epicodus is ultimately about <em>teaching you how to learn</em>. While you'll work with several specific languages during your program, you'll also be learning core concepts of programming that translate to essentially every other language out there. Picking up new languages down the road won't be as hard as it sounds!</p>
        <p>Still, there's something to be said for developing a strong foundation in languages that truly interest you. This quick quiz can help point you in the right direction.</p>
